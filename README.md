# New types for Apple HomeKit

### App support lib: [HomeCenter for HomeKit](https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/homecenter-for-homekit/id1329662539?mt=8)

Hello dear developer community. Let's clean up the new types of HomeKit.
While Apple has forgotten about our needs, everyone adds their services and characteristics as he wants.
At the same time, in every project or even a HometKit-Ready device - completely different data types and storage locations can be used - for the same kinds of data.
As a result, it can not be controlled. Please let's stick to a single standard until Apple remembers us.
